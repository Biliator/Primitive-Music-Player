# Music player

This is a primitive music player for Android. It detects MP3 files in a phone and allows you to play them.

## 📚 Introduction

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

This app is very old. It is recommended to test it with jdk-15 and beloved. Although I upgraded this app in 2024, originally it was created in 2017, so it might not work on every device. It had a problem with detecting MP3 files.
